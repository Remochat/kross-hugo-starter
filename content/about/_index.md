Hey there ! I'm Geraldine, the Designer/ "communicator" behind **beyond frames.**

I grew up at a crossroads between the wet West and the sunny South of France. 

I like to think/ assume that my interest for the contrasts positions (my interest in contrasting positions ??) comes from here. and to create links between fields, professional actors, people.

These days, I live in ZÃ¼rich and work with entrepreneurs. Together, we are advancing their business on digital aspects.

I am most happy in the water when I can lead visual projects from concept to production. I design impactful, innovative and customized digital and editorial products.

Personally, I love kitesurfing and creating new designs and develop UX design, I am obsessed with my motorbike and I try to get away in it as much as possible. 

Let's work together !
